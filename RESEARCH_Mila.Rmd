# RESEARCH

The research of our group is focused on developing methodologies concerning the following key areas:

## Multivariate Quantiles

We specialize in the development of advanced M-quantiles techniques for analyzing the multivariate distributions, going beyond traditional quantile-based approaches.

## Machine Learning

We integrate machine learning methods into quantile regression analysis, leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.

## Quantile Graphical Models

We develop graphical models that allow for the exploration of dependencies between variables based on quantiles, which provides robust insights into data relationships.

## Mixed Frequency Data

We have developed quantile regression models to integrate and analyze data observed at different frequencies.

## Hidden Markov Models

We investigate the use of Hidden Markov Models in quantile regression with applications in time series analysis and more.

## Finite Mixture Models and Mixed-Effects Models

We explore mixed-effects modeling approaches for analyzing hierarchical and nested data structures concerning a variety of empirical applications.

Our work has found application in:

- **Small Area Models in Poverty Mapping**: Our research group contributes to poverty mapping by using small area models to estimate and visualize poverty levels at fine spatial scales.

- **Finance**: The methodologies developed in our group have been applied to study financial risk measures of financial index and energy commodities.

- **Longitudinal data settings**: [You can provide more information about the applications in longitudinal data settings here.]
